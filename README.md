# Weather Prediction AIML

This project focuses on predicting weather conditions using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. The model is built using the RandomForest algorithm and predicts the weather using two different methods: based on the date and based on climate properties.

## Features

- **Date-Based Prediction**: Predicts weather conditions for a given date.
- **Climate Properties Prediction**: Predicts weather conditions based on various climate properties (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).

## Algorithms Used

- **RandomForest**: A robust and powerful ensemble learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
